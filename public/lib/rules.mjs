//   parlay of 2 or 3+ games (限2關 / 限3關), so nobody can lean on it alone;
//   the bands are narrow, so few picks carry one;
// - a long price stays on sale with more margin on it (the favourite-longshot
//   shade: past LONG_FROM only part of the price is paid, as a bookmaker
//   shortens the outsiders it can price least well), and is locked only when
//   it's far out (an ordinary game market at 30, a many-outcome one at 150).
//   Locking every price from 8 locked both sides of most lopsided pairs (an
//   F1 teammate head to head showed three locks in four).

// is sold only in a parlay, and locked only when it's all but decided.
