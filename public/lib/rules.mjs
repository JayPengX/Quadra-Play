// - a very short price (a near-certain pick) is locked, or sold only inside a
//   parlay of 2 or 3+ games (限2關 / 限3關), so nobody can lean on it alone;
// - a long price on an ordinary game market (a lopsided game's underdog, a far
//   line) is locked: the house can't price it well and won't carry the risk.
// Markets built around long prices (correct score, top inning, winning
// margins) stay open further out. F1 and championships are priced one by one
// up to the lottery's 500 and have no long-price lock, but a runaway favourite
// is locked: it can't be hidden in a parlay like a short game price, and a
// championship all but decided would be a free bet if its price lags.

// board: the page marks them as an estimate.

// and grows with the house's risk:
// - how sure the fair price is: the gap between the sources (a pick whose
//   sources disagree by 3 points costs about 3 points more);
// - how well the league is known: the big North American leagues and the top
//   European soccer leagues add nothing, other leagues a little, sports with
//   one bookmaker's line only (tennis, table tennis, Asian baseball…) more;
// - how far a line is from the main one: each step out adds a little;
// - live (場中): prices move under the house, as measured (1.16).
// With no extra risk the cut is the measured one, so an MLB game with both
// sources prices exactly as the lottery's board did (1.151-1.158); the
