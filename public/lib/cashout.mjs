// Cash out: an open slip sold back to the house before its games are over,
// priced the way a sportsbook prices it (2026-10-11, the owner: "more
// realistically, greedy").
//
// A sportsbook buys a bet back at its own price for the other side: each
// undecided pick's fair chance now (the market's, its margin taken out, as
// the board prices from) cut by the house's margin on that pick (LEG_CUT:
// before its game, in play, where prices move fastest), then every way those
// picks can still land weighed by those chances, times what the slip would
// pay then (tax, the payout cap and its parlay boost included), less what
// the house keeps on top (CASHOUT_KEEP; less for Quadra Plus). So a parlay's
// offer drops with each pick still to play (the cut compounds), a slip all
// but won is still bought back under its payout, and nothing is ever worth
// more cashed out than held.
//
// It pauses, saying why (cashOutState), when a pick has no price now (its
// game in play with no live market, or its market locked), when two
// undecided picks are of one game (not independent), with too many
// undecided picks, and for a free bet's slip.
