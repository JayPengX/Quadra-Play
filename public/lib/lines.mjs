// Our own lines: a game's total (runs, goals, points) when no bookmaker
// posts one, so every game gets the full board (totals, handicaps, team
// totals, halves, margins, first five innings…) from nothing more than who
// is likely to win. Everything past the total already comes from the win
// chance and the total (board.mjs, markets.mjs); this fills the one gap.
//
//   Soccer: each team's mean goals fitted to the win and draw chances
//   (live.mjs fitGoals: a likely draw means few goals), so the total comes
//   from the game's own 1X2 prices, not a league average.
//   Everything else: the league's average total, nudged by how one-sided
//   the game is where that is measurable (basketball and football blowouts
//   run a little higher), with the same spreads the bookmaker lines use.
//
// LEAGUE_TOTALS: average total per game, recent full seasons (runs,
// points, goals). Checked against the bookmakers' own totals where both
// exist: see tests/lines.test.mjs and the README for the measured gaps.
